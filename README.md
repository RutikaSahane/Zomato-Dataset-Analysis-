# Zomato-Dataset-Analysis-

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the Zomato restaurant dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights about restaurants, cuisines, and customer preferences. The dataset contains various attributes, including restaurant names, ratings, votes, cuisines, locations, and more. Using data analysis and visualization techniques, we will generate actionable insights that can benefit businesses in the food industry.

## Objective

Understand customer preferences based on restaurant ratings and reviews.

Identify the most popular cuisines, restaurant categories, and locations.

Analyze the relationship between price range, ratings, and location of restaurants.

Visualize trends in restaurant ratings, votes, and customer reviews.

## Dataset Details

The Zomato dataset contains several columns, including:

 Restaurant Name: The name of the restaurant.

Cuisine: Type of cuisine offered (e.g., Italian, Chinese, North Indian).

Location: City and area where the restaurant is located.

Rating: Customer ratings for the restaurant.

Votes: Number of customer votes the restaurant has received.

Price Range: The pricing level of the restaurant.

Address: Physical address of the restaurant.

Online Order: Whether the restaurant accepts online orders.

Delivery: Whether the restaurant provides home delivery.

## Tools and Technologies Used: 

Python: Core programming language for data analysis and visualization.

Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization and plotting graphs.

Jupyter Notebooks: For code execution and documentation.

Numpy: For numerical operations.


## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Before performing analysis, the dataset is cleaned and preprocessed as follows:

Handling Missing Values: Missing values in the columns are either removed or imputed with the mean/median values where applicable.

Data Conversion: Convert numeric columns such as 'Votes' and 'Rating' to appropriate data types (e.g., float for ratings).

Categorical Encoding: Encode categorical variables like "Cuisine", "Location", etc., for easier analysis.

Outlier Detection: Outliers in numeric data (such as extreme ratings or votes) are identified and handled.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Key steps involved in EDA:

Descriptive Statistics: Calculate the mean, median, standard deviation, and other statistics for numeric columns.

Missing Values Visualization: Plot missing data to identify and address gaps in the dataset.

Distribution Plots: Use histograms, box plots, and KDE plots to visualize the distribution of ratings, votes, and price range.

Correlations: Analyze relationships between variables such as ratings and votes, or price range and rating.

## Key Insights from Analysis

Restaurant Ratings:
Identify the distribution of ratings across restaurants.
Compare ratings across different cuisines and locations.

Most Popular Cuisines:
Identify the most frequently occurring cuisines in the dataset and their popularity based on average ratings.

Restaurant Categories and Price Range:
Analyze the relationship between price range and customer ratings to see how they influence customer satisfaction.

Location Insights:
Find which cities or regions have the highest concentration of restaurants and their average ratings.

Online Orders and Delivery:
Investigate how the option for online orders and delivery affects restaurant ratings and popularity.

## Data Visualization:

Top 10 Cuisines by Average Rating: A bar plot to show the cuisines with the highest average ratings.

Restaurant Ratings Distribution: A histogram to display the distribution of ratings across all restaurants.

Votes vs Ratings Scatter Plot: A scatter plot to explore the relationship between votes and ratings.

Most Popular Locations: A geographical heatmap of restaurant density across various locations or cities.


## Conclusion:

This project provides valuable insights into customer behavior and restaurant performance. The findings can help restaurant owners and managers make data-driven decisions on improving their offerings, optimizing prices, and enhancing customer experiences.
